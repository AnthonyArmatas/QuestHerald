# QuestHerald
World Of Warcraft (Classic) addon which plays mp3s when a quest is opened or about to be completed.

Alpha of QuestHelper. Only contains quests for Elywnn Forest. Automatically plays the quest objective and description. 
Commands and the gui allow the user to toggle the objective and descriptions on or off. Audio stops when a quest is accepted or completes. 
Cannot play from questlog yet, but looking into the implementation.
